# OpenLemma

A curated library of formally verified mathematical results produced by LLM agents, built on Lean 4 and Mathlib.

## What is this?

OpenLemma collects reusable lemmas and theorems that emerged from LLM agent experiments on open mathematical problems (primarily from the [Erdős Problems](https://erdosproblems.com/) database). Every result in `botlib/` compiles with **zero sorrys and zero axioms**.

The library is organized into two parts:

- **`botlib/`** — Compiler-verified lemmas (0 sorrys, 0 axioms). Safe to import as dependencies.
- **`problems/`** — Problem-specific results that may contain citation axioms for well-known theorems not yet in Mathlib (e.g., Zsygmondy's theorem).

## Provenance and prior work

All results were produced by LLM agents (Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google) with **zero human mathematical input**. The human role was limited to:

1. Selecting problems and writing Lean theorem statements
2. Building the agent infrastructure (task management, workflow design)
3. Reviewing and curating the outputs

### Prior work on Erdős 728

The proof strategy for 728 — reducing to binomial divisibility, applying Kummer's carry interpretation, and counting "good" values of m in [M, 2M] — is closely related to prior human work:

- **Pomerance (2015)**, ["Divisors of the Middle Binomial Coefficient"](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/catalan5.pdf), *Amer. Math. Monthly*. Proved that for fixed k, the set of n where (n+k) | C(2n,n) has density 1, using Kummer's theorem and digit randomness.
- **Sothanaphan (2026)**, ["Resolution of Erdős Problem #728"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07421). Writeup of GPT-5.2/Aristotle's Lean proof. Extended Pomerance to growing k ≍ log n using "carry-rich but spike-free" counting.
- **Our 728b agents** independently converged on the same high-level strategy but used Chernoff concentration bounds (Hoeffding's inequality over digit spaces) instead of carry-rich/spike-free sieve counting.

We cannot distinguish whether agents independently discovered this approach (Kummer → digit counting is arguably the natural strategy) or reproduced it from training data containing Pomerance's paper. This is the ["subconscious plagiarism"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22401) problem identified by the DeepMind Aletheia team: LLMs may reproduce absorbed proof strategies without attribution. Formal verification confirms correctness but cannot confirm originality.

### On the question of AI creating math

This is the question we're interested in. Not "can AI solve problems" (tree search) but "can AI produce reusable abstractions?" The test is empirical: if these lemmas get used by others (human or AI), that's evidence of genuine contribution.

The Factor Pump and Smooth Escape Lemma (from Erdős 410) are the most interesting cases — they emerged when agents *couldn't* solve the target problem and explored laterally instead. Whether these represent novel mathematics or recombination of training data is a question we lack the expertise to answer; a number theorist's evaluation would be needed.

See the [friction report](https://gist.github.com/jarredbarber/c541d6d7f35582d97fffc227b2dde692) for analysis of agent failure modes when working with Lean/Mathlib.
