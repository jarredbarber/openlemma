ESTIMATES OF THE LEAST PRIME FACTOR
OF A BINOMIAL COEFFICIENTP. ERDÖS, C B. LACAMPAGNE,AND J. L. SELFRIDGEDedicated to the memory ofD. H. LehmerAbstract. We estimate the least prime factor p of the binomial coefficient(£) for k > 2 . The conjecture that p < max(N/k, 29) is supported by
considerable numerical evidence. Call a binomial coefficient good if p > k .
For 1 < i < k write N - k + i = a,è, , where b¡ contains just those primefactors > k , and define the deficiency of a good binomial coefficient as thenumber of i for which b,■= 1 . Let g(k) be the least integer N > k + 1 suchthat (£) is good. The bound g(k) > ck2/lnk is proved. We conjecture that
our list of 17 binomial coefficients with deficiency > 1 is complete, and it seems
that the number with deficiency 1 is finite. All (^ ) with positive deficiency andk < 101 are listed.1. Good binomial coefficientsConsider a sequence of k > 2 positive integers {n + i} = n+l,...,n + k,with n + i = a¡bj , where p\a¡ implies p < k , and p\b¡ implies p > k for anyprime p ; i.e., the a, have the prime factors up to k , and the b¡ have all thelarger prime factors.Since the binomial coefficient ("J ) is an integer, A:!| FTa; . We are concerned with the least prime factor of any number in the sequence, except forthose composing k\ , that is, the least prime factor of (n^k) ■Definition 1A. A sequence of consecutive integers axbx , ... , akbk , where p\a,implies p < k , and p\b¡ implies p > k , is said to be good if \Ja,■ = k\ .We denote the least prime factor of m by p(m). We frequently find it
convenient to write N = n + k .Definition IB. The binomial coefficient (Nk)is said to be good if p((Nk)) > k .Note that Definition IB is equivalent to stating that the ^-sequence {N -k + /} is good or that 11^; = k\ or that gcd((^), k\) = 1 . Further, when kis fixed and (^) is good, we say that N is good with respect to k .Ecklund, Erdös, and Selfridge [1] studied the function g(k), the least in-teger N > k + 1 such that />((*)) > k , so g(k) is the least N ■whichis good with respect to k. They showed that g(k) > 2k for k > 4 andestablished weak upper and lower bounds on g(k). They determined g(k)Received by the editor July 27, 1992 and, in revised form, December 11, 1992..1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Sequences satisfying(5) were characterized in [2]. For a given k the a, are always a permutationof I, ... , k and the number of such permutations is always a power of 2.For example, when k = 2459, there are five operations which we call 211swap, 37 swap, 74 swap, 2459 swap (followed by symmetric flip), and 1229+ 2 twin prime double swap, yielding 32 permutations which can be writtenimmediately. A more mundane example is provided by k = 5 , which admitsa 22 swap, yielding just two permutations. When « = 210 for instance, the a,are 1, 4, 3, 2, 5 and the b¡ are 211, 53, 71, 107, 43.If none of the b¡ = 1 and k\n + i, then /?((« + i)/k) < (n + i)/k < N/k . Soour conjecture remains to be verified only for those good binomial coefficientswhere at least one of the b,■= 1 . If TV is very large compared to k (forexample, if N > k\), then b¡ > 1 for all i.Schinzel has conjectured that for every k there is an N > 2k such thatthe bi are all prime. We note that (k) can be the product of fewer than kprimes all greater than k. For example, when k = 25 and n = 2080, then
bxo = bx3 = b2o = I, and the other b¡ are all prime. Since (^j5) is good, it isthe product of these 22 primes, each greater than 25.Definition 2. If (^) is good, we call the number of / such that b¡ = 1 thedeficiency of (^) and use the notation d(N, k) or d in context.Thus ¿(2105, 25) = 3 and ¿(215, 5) = 0 .Theorem 3. If (^) is good, and N > c^2k\fk (where ct, < 0.4 when k > 94),then d(N, k) = 0 . (For k < 94, see Tables 2 and 3.)The proof of Theorem 3 depends on the following lemma.Lemma 2. If (£) is good, then û/|/(*) •Proof of Lemma 2. We use the alternative form a¡ = ak_¡ , 0 < j < k . Ifpa \ak_j , then pa \n + k - j , so N mod pa = j mod pa . Since (%) is good,j mod pa > k mod pa by Lemma 1. Put qpa < j < (q + 1)pa ; there are q mul-tiples of pa among I, ... , j . But since k mod pa < j mod pa , there are q + 1multiples of pa among the j + 1 numbers k, k — I, ... , k —j . The same
argument shows that there is one more multiple of pd among k, ... , k - j
than among I,..., j for any d < a . Each d > 1 contributes a count of oneto the power of p dividingk(k-\)---(k-j+l)(k-j) ={k_ ^ /k\which is therefore a multiple of pa . Thus, ak-j\(k - j)(kk_¡) for 0 <j <k . dProof of Theorem 3. By Lemma 2, a¡ < i(k) . The maximum for this boundoccurs when /'= [(k + \)/2\ . If k is even, a, <(k/2)(k,2) < 2k sfk/2n , using
Stirling's formula. For k odd, k > 95, a, < 0.42k\/k . So if N - k is largerthan this maximum, then none of the b¡ equals 1.

Tables 2and 3 give the results of our computer search.Notice that in Table 3 below there is a positive deficiency at k = 100 nearthe top of our search range. But for k > 20 our published remark [3, p. 523]that for each k there seems to be an N such that d(N, k) = 1 is way off base.In fact, the first k for which d(N, k) = 0 for all good (£) is 13.We conjecture that k = 42 is the last k with d(N, k) > 1 , and fromlooking at the tables, one gets the idea that there are only finitely many binomialcoefficients with d(N, k) > 0 . The only values of k < 42 for which d = 0for all good TVare 13, 20, 21, 22, 24, 29, 31, 37. However, for 42 < k < 101there are only 13 values of k with d(N, k) = 1 for some N, and none withd > 1 for any N.Notice also that whenever we found d(N, k) > 1, then d(g(k), k) > 1 .There are 11 values of k < 46 with d(g(k), k) = 1 . We conjecture thatd(g(k), k) = 0 for k > 46 ; this has been checked up to k = 149 .If N > k2 , then (662)is the only known exception to p((£)) < N/k . Ifthere were to be any further exceptional binomial coefficients (£) in Case 1,the following four conditions would all have to be satisfied: 1. d(N, k) > 0,so k > 101 . 2. N > g(k) . 3. If b, ¿ 1 , then b¡ is prime. 4. If b,-^ 1, thena, < k .Remark 1. The probability that one of the k consecutive integers of {« + /}is divisible by a prime just larger than k is close to 1. Thus, if N > k3 , therewill almost always be a prime factor less than or equal to N/k .Case 2. 2k < N < k2 .Lemma 3. We have p(r)\(rk) .Proof. Let p = p(r) and pa\\rk . Then rk mod/?" = 0 < k mod/?0 . Thus,by Lemma 1, p(r)\(rk) . So at N = k2 , (£) has a prime factor p(k) < k =N/k . DRemark 2. If N = k2 - 1, then p((Nk))< N/k .Proof. Let p=p(k - 1). Then A^modp = 0 and k mod p= 1 .

ERDÖS, C. B. LACAMPAGNE, AND J. L. SELFRIDGEWhen N/k is small, it is unacceptably small as a bound for p((k)) ■ In fact,there are infinitely many binomial coefficients with p((1)) = 3 > N/k whenN <3k .Theorem 4. For each k > 2 there is an N, 2k < N < 4k , such that p((Nk)) >N/k .Proof. Let 2r~l < k < 2r and let N = 2r + k . Then by Lemma 1, (£) is odd,since N = k mod 2a for a = 1, ... , r . But if (¿ ) is odd and 2k < N < 3k ,then p((")) > 3 > N/k . Now there will always be an N = 2r + k , 2k <2r + k < 3k , except when 2r = 2k . But when 2r~ ' = k , then ( ^ ) is odd forall values of N such that 3k < N < 4k . Now take N = 3s + k , 2 • 3s - 1 or2 • 3s + k , whichever is in the region. By Lemma 1, 3 does not divide (^) . Sop((Nk))>5>N/k. DWe now combine Cases 1 and 2.Definition 3. If /?((£)) > N/k , then (^) is said to be exceptional.It would be very interesting if someone could prove our conjecture that thenumber of exceptional (^) with p > 17 is finite. We wrote a program to findall exceptional (^) where p > 5 and k < 12000 . The most unusual exceptionis for p = 29 : />((22884))= 29 . We have found one exception for p = 23 :/>((46764))= 23 . There appear to be exactly two exceptions for p = 19 : (662)and (™) .We have two further conjectures:1. The only exceptional (Nk) with p > 17 are these four.2. p({Nk))<N/k if N> 17±£ .Notice that 1. is a bit stronger and implies 2.We have found eight exceptional (Nk) with /? = 17: (^ , (43339), (35'67),(ÎS) - &!) - (SS) - C8%3). (^7) - and two near misses: (2349)and (™) .Our program gave only one output for 331 < k < 625, namely, p((3450764))=13, and no p > 13 for any k other than those already listed. Thus, at this
point in time, it is still possible that p((k)) < max(N/k, 13), with the twelveexceptions listed above.3. A RELATED PROBLEMWe now turn our attention to a related problem. We study the number ofindices i where b¡ = 1 without requiring that (%) be good.Theorem 5. Assume N >2k and denote by f(N, k) the number of indices ifor which b¡ > 1 . Then f(N, k) > (1 - e)n(k) for k > k0(e) .Proof. We use the strong form of the prime number theorem: the number ofprimes p such that N - k < p < N is greater than (1 - e)n(k) if N < kx+cfor any c < 1/3 . This immediately gives the theorem for 2k < N < k4¡3 .In fact, the contribution to b¡ > 1 from primes k < p < N/2 becomessignificant even when N = (2 + S)k . When N = 3k , use the quoted theoremfor k < p < N/2 and 2k < p < N to get f(N, k) > (§ - e)n(k) for large k ,and similarly one can get f(N,k)>(\+p)n(k) when N > (2 + S)k .License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see https://www.ams.org/journal-terms-of-useESTIMATESOF THE LEAST PRIME FACTOR OF A BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT 223Now if N > k4!3, we will show that f(N, k) > k/8 for k large enough.First observe that (¿) > Nk/kk . The well-known result that pa < N whenPQ||(fc) f°n°ws easily from Lemma 1. Thus we have(6) Nk/kk< (^kN'WnM-U.Now N3'4 > k and, for k > 104 , n(k) < k/S . Thus, from (6), using N/k >
N1'4 , we get Nkl4 < Nk/kk < Nk'sN^N'kx and thus f(N, k) > k/S > n(k) ,which finishes the proof of the theorem. □It would be quite difficult to give good explicit inequalities for f(N, k).Corollary 3. If N > 2k , there are at least (I - e)n(k) primes greater than k
dividing (£) . In fact, when N < k2 , the count of primes greater than k isf(N, k), since all b¡ are prime.Notice that /(21, 10) = 3 < 7t(20) - 7t(10) = 4 . Is it true that for everyt there are integers N and k for which f(N, k) < n(2k) - n(k) - t ? For/(213, 100) we can take t = 3 .We conjecture that there are examples with arbitrarily large t. Suppose thereis a large gap in the primes between pr and pr+l . Take N = pr+x - 1 and2k = pr + 1 . Then f(N,k) is the number of primes between N - k and N,plus the number of primes between k and N/2 . Since n(N) = n(2k), we getf(N, k) = n(2k) - n(k) - (n(N - k) - n(N/2)).As an example, the first gap of 320 between consecutive primes is listed byLander and Parkin [4]. Put N = 2300942868 and k = 1150471275 . Theprimes between N/2 and N - k are 11-50471000+ 297, 307, 319, 369, 373,393, 417, giving an example with t = 1 .From the strong form of the prime number theorem, we deduce that onlythe interval 2k < N < 2k + kc has to be searched. No doubt the only possibleexamples with large t lie in the interval 2k < N < 2k + c In k , where c =c(t) > 0 .Acknowledgment
